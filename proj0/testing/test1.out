# This is a script produced by the --testing option to your program.
# It indicates states of the game board that would be shown to a player
# (after a new tile is created and added to the board and after a tilt that
# changes the board.)
#   * Lines of the form
#         B N s m t00 t01 t02 t03 t10 t11 t12 t13 ... t33
#     denote dumps of the board where N is the board size, s is the score of
#     the current game, m is the maximum final score so far in this session
#     (0 until the end of the first game) and trc is the value of the tile
#     at row r, column c, or 0 if there is no tile there.
#   * Lines of the form
#         E N s m t00 t01 t02 t03 t10 t11 t12 t13 ... t33
#     are the same as those starting with B, but additionally indicate that
#     the game is ended.
#   * Lines starting with # and blank lines are ignored.
